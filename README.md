# Currency Arbitrage 
Exploit currency arbitrage opportunity (if any) by using mechanism of `triangular arbitrage`

## Concept
From Investopedia

### Currency Arbitrage
> A forex strategy in which a currency trader takes advantage of different spreads offered by brokers for a particular currency pair by making trades. Different spreads for a currency pair imply disparities between the bid and ask prices. Currency arbitrage involves buying and selling currency pairs from different brokers to take advantage of this disparity.

### Triangular Arbitrage

> Triangular arbitrage is the process of converting one currency to another, converting it again to a third currency and, finally, converting it back to the original currency within a short time span. This opportunity for riskless profit arises when the currency's exchange rates do not exactly match up. Triangular arbitrage opportunities do not happen very often and when they do, they only last for a matter of seconds. Traders that take advantage of this type of arbitrage opportunity usually have advanced computer equipment and/or programs to automate the process.

## Example
From Investopedia

### Currency Arbitrage
> For example, two different banks (Bank A and Bank B) offer quotes for the US/EUR currency pair. Bank A sets the rate at 3/2 dollars per euro, and Bank B sets its rate at 4/3 dollars per euro. In currency arbitrage, the trader would take one euro, convert that into dollars with Bank A and then back into euros with Bank B. The end result is that the trader who started with one euro now has 9/8 euro. The trader has made a 1/8 euro profit if trading fees are not taken into account.

### Triangular Arbitrage
> Suppose you have $1 million and you are provided with the following exchange rates: EUR/USD = 0.8631, EUR/GBP = 1.4600 and USD/GBP = 1.6939. 

> With these exchange rates there is an arbitrage opportunity: 

> Sell dollars for euros: $1 million x 0.8631 = 863,100 euros
> Sell euros for pounds: 863,100/1.4600 = 591,164.40 pounds
> Sell pounds for dollars: 591,164.40 x 1.6939 = $1,001,373 dollars 

> $1,001,373 - $1,000,000 = $1,373

> From these transactions, you would receive an arbitrage profit of $1,373 (assuming no transaction costs or taxes).
